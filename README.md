This GitHub repository is a collection of all the labs that I (Kieran Llarena) have completed over the past Fall 2023 Semester in my CIS 150L class

I am pushing this code to GitHub so that it may be viewed by any internship recruiters as a way to showcase what I have learned

## Course Description

CIS 150, otherwise known as Computer Science I, is an introductory class to C++ and the Object-oriented programming paradigm

CIS 150L is the lab corequisite for CIS150

### CIS 150 Description

This course provides a foundation for further studies in computer and information science and emphasizes a structured approach to problem solving and algorithm development. Topics include principles of program design, coding, debugging, testing, and documentation. Students are introduced to the Unified Modeling Language for requirements analysis using use-cases and activity diagrams, an object oriented programming language, and the fundamentals of computer hardware, system software, and components. The course will consist of three lecture hours and one two-hour laboratory.

## Lab Procedure

1. Read the assigned lab number manual assignment instructions. Each lab will be composed of at least one assignment. This means that there can be multiple assignments in one lab
2. Create the code that matches the requirements for said assignment per lab. This means creating the code from scratch. However, _some_ assignments provide unfinished code that just needs to be finished by filling in the unfinished parts
3. Validate your created code with unit tests by comparing the desired and produced output given a set input. These unit tests will be provided in the lab manuals. Edit your code until it has passed all unit tests
4. Create a lab report that is composed of two parts:

   (1) screenshots of your code with explanations of how your code works

   (2) screenshots of your unit tests
